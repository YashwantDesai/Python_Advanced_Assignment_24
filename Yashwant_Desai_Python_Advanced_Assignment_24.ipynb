    "One characteristic of a module is that it encapsulates a reusable set of functions, classes, and variables, which can be organized in a single file. Modules allow you to structure and separate your code into manageable and reusable units. This helps improve code organization and maintainability by keeping related code together and making it easy to reuse across different parts of your program.Each module creates its own namespace, which acts as a container for the objects defined within that module. This helps prevent naming conflicts.Modules can be imported using the import statement, which makes the code within the module accessible to other parts of your program.Python comes with a rich standard library that includes a wide range of modules for various tasks, such as math for mathematical operations, os for interacting with the operating system, and datetime for working with dates and times. We can create your own custom modules to encapsulate code that you want to reuse across different parts of your application. \n",
